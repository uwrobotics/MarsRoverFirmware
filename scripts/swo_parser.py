class Stream:
    """
    Stream of messages for one of the 32 ITM channels.

    ITM Trace messages can be output on one of 32 channels. The stream class 
    contains a byte buffer for one of these channels. Once a newline character
    is received, the buffer is dumped to stdout. Also, there is an optional
    string that is prepended to the start of each line. This is useful for
    using different channels for different logging levels.

    For example, one might use channel 0 for info messages, channel 1 for
    warnings, and channel 2 for errors. One might like to use "INFO: ",
    "WARNING: ", and "ERROR: " as the headers for these channels. The debugger
    can enable and disable these channels on startup if you want to only see
    error messages. This would actually prevent the info and warning messages
    from being generated by the processor, which will save time in the code
    because ITM routines are blocking.

    Each stream also has the option to echo to the GDB console. Simply pass
    the socket connected to the Tcl server to the constructor
