          It increments a counter when the same value is read, and decrements it when the value is different.

          As for what is considered as an invalid read, for delay debouncing, it is when delay time has
          not passed, or the read is different from the value before the delay (the read is a noise);
          for integrating debounce, it is when there is less than m_integratingDebounceThres consecutive\

          hgfedcba with a being bit 0, b being bit 1, c being bit 2 and so on.
